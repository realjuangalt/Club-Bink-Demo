Title: Building Trust-Based Community Markets for Bitcoin Exchange: A Calculator for Collaborative Trading

### Abstract
The concept of trust is pivotal in creating sustainable and resilient economic systems, especially for decentralized assets like Bitcoin. This project aims to develop a community-based calculator platform that facilitates peer-to-peer Bitcoin trading among trusted individuals, without the involvement of intermediaries. The proposed platform includes a pricing calculator, an integrated calendar for reminders, and an easy onboarding process that reinforces the importance of Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) as an investment strategy. It combines community trust, transparent pricing, and consistent onboarding to create a resilient local marketplace for Bitcoin trading.

### Introduction
Bitcoin was born from libertarian ideals of decentralization and financial sovereignty, but the majority of trades today rely on centralized exchanges and intermediaries. This project seeks to leverage the power of local trust networks to enable decentralized Bitcoin trading, ensuring the process is not only secure but also deeply rooted in community relationships.

The project's core idea revolves around building a platform that allows trusted individuals to buy and sell Bitcoin regularly within their communities, without a third party or escrow. By using web-of-trust mechanisms, calendar reminders, and a calculator to ensure fair pricing, we aim to create a sustainable trading environment based on mutual understanding and a shared belief in financial freedom.

### Problem Statement
Traditional centralized exchanges compromise on privacy, expose users to unnecessary security risks, and fail to adequately reflect the spirit of Bitcoin's decentralization. This thesis addresses the challenge of fostering Bitcoin adoption through peer-to-peer trust, using tools that help individuals connect, set fair prices, and establish consistent purchasing patterns based on trust levels.

### Objectives
- Develop a calculator tool that assists with Bitcoin price determination, ensuring a fair exchange rate for both buyer and seller.
- Implement a calendar system integrated with email notifications, ensuring regular trades through Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA).
- Build a trust-based onboarding system where sellers invite buyers and assign trust levels to manage risk effectively.
- Create an intuitive platform that educates users on the power of DCA for Bitcoin investment.
- Enable seamless peer-to-peer trade with minimal reliance on third-party services.

### Platform Components
1. **Trust-Based Onboarding System**
   - **Invitation Model**: Sellers invite potential buyers from within their personal networks.
   - **Trust Assignment**: Sellers assign a trust level to each buyer, defining a comfortable trading volume without using escrow.

2. **Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) Calculator**
   - **Pricing Transparency**: Connect to an API for real-time Bitcoin pricing, providing both buyers and sellers with a fair rate.
   - **Dollar Cost Averaging Education**: A simple educational module explaining DCA, emphasizing the long-term advantages of consistent, small-scale investment.

3. **Calendar & Notification System**
   - **Commitment Scheduling**: Buyers commit to purchasing a set amount of Bitcoin at regular intervals, facilitated by a calendar reminder.
   - **Email and App Integration**: Integration with calendar applications and email notifications ensures buyers and sellers are reminded of their upcoming trades.

### Concept of Trust and Risk Management
- **Web of Trust**: Sellers operate based on their assessment of each buyer's trustworthiness. The level of trust influences the volume of Bitcoin that can be safely traded without the use of escrow or third-party guarantees.
- **Scaling Trust**: Trust can scale through consistent, reliable trades, with both parties gaining confidence and increasing trading volume over time.
- **Risk Management**: Initial limits are set by sellers to minimize risk, e.g., a new buyer may initially be assigned a trust value of $100 per month, increasing with the buyer's consistency and reliability.

### Workflow of a Trade
1. **Onboarding**: Seller invites a buyer to join the platform, setting an initial trust level and a regular trading schedule.
2. **Scheduling**: The platform schedules reminders for trades based on the agreed DCA plan.
3. **Price Calculation**: Real-time API data calculates the fair price for both parties at the time of each trade.
4. **Execution**: Buyer and seller meet in person or use a peer-to-peer method to execute the trade, with trust reducing the need for additional security mechanisms.

### Dollar Cost Averaging: Empowering Adoption
Dollar Cost Averaging is an effective way to mitigate the volatility often associated with Bitcoin. By focusing on small, regular investments, the platform lowers the barrier for newcomers and encourages a gradual accumulation of Bitcoin, spreading risk across time rather than attempting to "time the market." This section will explain the merits of DCA, supported by historical examples and data.

### Platform Design Considerations
- **User Interface**: Clean, intuitive, and informative, focusing on ease of use for newcomers.
- **Privacy and Security**: Emphasize data protection, user privacy, and ensure communications between participants are secure.
- **Community Emphasis**: Highlight the power of local Bitcoin networks, helping communities build resilience without intermediaries.

### Conclusion
The proposed platform serves as a tool for fostering local Bitcoin adoption by leveraging existing relationships. By focusing on trust, consistency, and education, this project aims to create resilient, decentralized marketplaces that function without the need for third-party oversight. The long-term vision is a network of individuals trading Bitcoin within trusted local communities, empowering financial independence and privacy.

### Future Research Directions
- **Scalability of Trust Networks**: How can the trust model scale beyond local communities while maintaining security?
- **Integration with Decentralized Identity (DID)**: Explore the potential use of decentralized identity systems to add an additional layer of trust.
- **Legal and Regulatory Challenges**: Understanding the legal landscape for peer-to-peer Bitcoin trading within various jurisdictions.
